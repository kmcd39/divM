\usage{
tracts.across.water(
  cz = NULL,
  cbsa = NULL,
  ctsf = NULL,
  .cos = NULL,
  area.floor = 0,
  write.path = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ctsf}{an sf object as returned by \code{tracts.from.region}. Can be NULL, in
which case they are retrieved based on \code{region.ids} argument}

\item{.cos}{counties, as downloaded from tigris. Downloads them if left as
null.}

\item{area.floor}{area floor for water polygon in sq km. I think leaving at 0
and effectively filtering with the tract overlay will be best.}

\item{write.path}{a file path to write output to.}

\item{...}{passed onto \code{polygonal.div}}
}
\description{
Water divisions are areas, rather than
}
