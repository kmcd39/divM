\usage{
trim.to.length.floors(
  region,
  divisions,
  minimum.segment.length = 10,
  minimum.hwy.length = 1000,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{minimum.segment.length}{Minimum length (meters) that each highway ~segment~
must have in order to be eligible for rays, This differs from
\code{minimum.hwy.length} in that it filters by each separate segment, rather
than overall hwy length}

\item{minimum.hwy.length}{Minimum length of each ~highway~ that must be inside
place boundaries for it to be ray-eligible. Differs from
\code{minimum.segment.length} in that at least one segment of hwy must meet this
threshold for ~any~ of the segments to be eligible. Only relevant if larger than
\code{minimum.segment.length}.}
}
\description{
Trims a set of highways to those for which the whole stretch of highway inside the
region has minimum length \code{length.floor} in meters. 1 km by default.
