Thank you very much for your interest in our curated dataset of parks managed for public outdoor recreation in the U.S. (PAD-US-AR). Please let us know if you encounter errors or have questions by emailing Matt Browning (mhb2@clemson.edu) and Scott Ogletree (scott.ogletree@ed.ac.uk).

To access the PAD-US-AR, please navigate to the '3_data' folder. The remaining folders are for accessing the source data, R scripts, and replication purposes.    

Please download the following folders (total size nearly 50 GB):

'0_scripts'
'1_source_data'
'2_intermediate_data'
'3_data'If you wish to reproduce the results of our Scientific Data manuscript, you will need to delete the files (but not the folders) in folders 2 and 3. These files are intermediate and output data files that are generated by the scripts. Please run all scripts in order. You will also need to uncompress two large raster images - one for tree canopy cover and one for NDVI. These are provided in folder 1_source_data/NLCD and 1_source_data/GEE. These are zip files that will extract into 10-20GB of data. Several have processes not running in parallel that may take hours to run. Please plan ahead accordingly (i.e., overnight). Some computers (i.e., older machines with less than 16 GB of memory) may not be able to complete the scripts. The models were run on a 2019 MacBook Pro with 2.6 GhZ 6-Core Intel chip & and 32 GB of memory, and validated on a 2022 custom-built Windows desktop with Ryzen 7 5600X and 32GB of memory, and a 2022 Macbook Pro (13 inches) with M2 chip and 24GB of unified memory.

!! Scripts were also run on R version 4.1.2 (x86_64 or ARM64). Scripts may not run correctly or may generate slightly different results on other versions. !!

If you wish to just use the PAD-US-AR data, you can navigate to folder 3. All the files you should need are there.We encourage you to cite the PAD-US-AR dataset on OSF (https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://osf.io/pwdsg/__;!!PTd7Sdtyuw!VcCw4HrPxj5Q64VUtTRQ6LZmYRBiHvduALZ_37ZHrpkJ77BCoMjrIthTv-qJfPzCJZnYeE-6nndsXrnd$  ) and doi (DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/PWDSG) as well as the Scientific Data manuscript (DOI is pending). We would also love to hear from you if you wish to collaborate on using or further manipulating these data. You can reach us at the email addresses above.
