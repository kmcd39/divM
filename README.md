# divM
Library that bundles measures of physical &amp; administrative dividedness measures of places and code used to generate. Generates counts of highway rays, counts of polygons regions are divided into by physical, administrative, and infrastructural boundaries. 

The library contains more-or-less flexible functions to generate these various measures in the R/ subdirectory
All code to generate sets of measures is (or will eventually be) in the data-raw/ directory and subfolders. Markdowns illustrating these measures are in most cases bundled with the code in subfolders in data-raw/

Eventually output measures for given datasets/parameters will be exported with the package.
