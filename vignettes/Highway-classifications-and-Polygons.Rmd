# Highway classifications & Polygons

This markdown walks through the generation of different versions of the polygon dividedness measure with the NHPN highway data. First it walks through different ways to setup/subset the NHPN highway data, and then shows how these affect the number of polygon subdivisions generated by the measure.

Load region + division boundaries to begin:

```{r load.nhpn}
# load & setup NHPN hwy data
# https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/national-highway-planning-network-nhpn
shp.dir <- "~/R/shapefiles/"
hwys <- st_read(paste0(shp.dir, "National_Highway_Planning_Network-shp/National_Highway_Planning_Network.shp"))

# get czs from my data storage pkg
czs <- divDat::czs

# make uniform metered crs -----------------------------------------------
czs <- czs %>% divM::conic.transform()
hwys <- hwys %>% divM::conic.transform()

```

## Subsetting by hwy types

There are many different ways to subset hwys within a region for generating the measures:

* By route type: "Interstate," "State route," "non-signed other arterial," etc.. (SIGNT1 in data)
* By "Functional classification": --- can get to "limited-access" hwys this way. (FCLASS in data)
* By spatial relationship: Interstates and all hwys (of X types) that intersect interstates

### Illustration case for philly:

```{r phl, echo=TRUE}

# get sample area & trim hwys
(phl <- czs[grepl("Philadelphia",czs$cz_name),] %>% divM::region.reorg("cz")) 
hwys <- hwys %>% st_crop(phl)

# use FCLASS to create a hwy subset
lac <- hwys %>% filter(FCLASS %in% divM::lac_codes |
                          SIGNT1 == "I") # all limited-access

# spatial group hwy data
hwys <- hwys %>% divM::denode.lines(group.cols = c("SIGNT1", "SIGN1"))
lac <- lac %>% divM::denode.lines(group.cols = c("SIGNT1", "SIGN1"))

# Get hwy subsets for philadelphia: ----
# all hwys
all <- divM::subset.polys.divs(region = phl,
                               div.sf = hwys)
# all interstates
int <- divM::subset.polys.divs(phl, hwys,
                               div.identifier.column = "SIGNT1",
                               always.include = "I", 
                               include.intersecting = F) 
 # all interstates and hwys that intersect interstates
tint <- divM::subset.polys.divs(phl,
                                hwys,
                                div.identifier.column = "SIGNT1",
                                always.include = "I",
                                include.intersecting = T)


lac <- divM::subset.polys.divs(phl,
                                lac)

# visualize differences
plot(all['SIGN1'], main = "all philly hwys", lwd=2)
plot(int['SIGN1'], main = "all philly interstates", lwd=2)
plot(tint['SIGN1'], main = "all philly interstates+touching",lwd=2)
plot(lac['SIGN1'], main = "all philly LAC",lwd=2)

```

## "Filling gaps" / The linebreak problem

Sometimes a hwy has a minuscule break. Often the hwy classification changes for an interchange or a short stretch. For example, I676 in Camden.

I run a helper fcn to fill these before generating polygons. The logic of the function is: If a line segment has an endpoint within x threshold of another segment, and they have the same hwy identifiers, I  connect the segments.

Default threshold for filling gap is 200 meters. The argument `threshold` can be passed to any wrapper function that fills gaps to change this.

Below are the 3 interstates in Philadelphia CZ that have these gaps.

```{r fillgaps.viz}

# filling gaps in Philly interstates:
viz.fix <- divM::Fix.all.hwys(int, return.gap.map = T, verbose = T)

viz.fix$I676
viz.fix$I76
viz.fix$I95

```

To continue creating the polygon measures, create versions of the above hwy subsets that have their gaps filled.
Suffix names with '.c'

```{r fillgaps}
int.c <- suppressWarnings(divM::Fix.all.hwys(int, verbose = F))
tint.c <- suppressWarnings(divM::Fix.all.hwys(tint, verbose = F))
lac.c <- suppressWarnings(divM::Fix.all.hwys(lac, verbose = F))
```


## Creating polygon measures

From here, creating the polygon measure is pretty straightforward. Fcn `polygonal.div` does the work; it takes linear division data and a polygon representing study area. 

Let's see how it looks based on the different hwy subsets and whether or not the gaps are filled.
I use CZ as boundary.

The other core parameter for generating these measures is the area floor--- the minimum size of each polygon subdivisions. If a polygon is formed that is below this area, it is filtered out and not counted towards the total. By default this floor is 1/2 square km.

```{r polys}
# Summary table:
Summary.table <- 
  tibble( gaps_filled = c(FALSE, TRUE)
           ,interstates_only = c(divM::polygonal.div(phl, int)$n.polys,
                                 divM::polygonal.div(phl, int.c)$n.polys)
           ,interstates_intersecting = c(divM::polygonal.div(phl, tint)$n.polys,
                                         divM::polygonal.div(phl, tint.c)$n.polys)
           ,limited_access = c(polygonal.div(phl, lac)$n.polys,
                                 polygonal.div(phl, lac.c)$n.polys)
           )

knitr::kable(Summary.table)

# to view the polygons as map, ask the same function to return.sf to map
polygonal.div(phl, lac.c, return.sf = T) %>%
  select("id") %>%
  plot(main = "LAC polygons in philly")


```

# Wrapping Up

To end on a pun, a single function, `Polys.wrapper`, can replicate this whole workflow: of subsetting the hwys, filling the gaps, and generating the polygons. It will pass on any arguments to its wrapped fcns.
See full options with `?Polys.wrapper`.


```{r wrap.up}

Polys.wrapper(phl, lac,
              fill.gaps = T)

```
